It&#8217;s crucial to ensure that the content is clear, concise, and relevant to the learners&#8217; needs. Also, you need to include assessments or quizzes to measure learners&#8217; understanding of the material.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I find that <strong>Articulate Rise<\/strong> lets me create beautiful, responsive e-learning courses that\u2019ll look perfect on any device in a matter of hours.&nbsp; Click here to see an example module on <a href=\"https:\/\/rise.articulate.com\/share\/8WXeEWwufOjFadod2R3OdIn7yd9wqOBW#\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Food Allergy Awareness<\/a> that highlights what is possible using Articulate Rise.&nbsp; Building content in Rise is easy &#8211; just need to add relevant blocks.

Totara LMS allows you to collect feedback from learners through surveys or feedback forms. You can also review the course analytics to identify any knowledge gaps or areas where learners struggled. Using this feedback, you can improve your compliance training course and ensure that it meets the learners&#8217; needs. However, to analyse the feedback you would need to visit multiple courses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Centralised feedback:<\/strong> I prefer to create feedback forms in 1 course in the LMS. From all other courses, I use the <strong>URL resource<\/strong> to create a link to the course with feedback in it. I can pass the course ID and employee details as URL attributes to pre-populate the feedback form (using a little bit of JavaScript). This way, I can export and analyse feedback for all courses within the LMS.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, setting up a compliance training course using Totara LMS is a straightforward process that involves defining your training needs, creating course content, setting up the course in Totara LMS, assigning the course to relevant learners, monitoring their progress, and evaluating the effectiveness of the course. By following these steps, you can ensure that your organisation is compliant with legal and regulatory requirements while also providing your employees with the knowledge and skills they need to perform their roles effectively.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Compliance training is an essential part of any organisations learning and development strategy, as it helps ensure that employees understand and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
